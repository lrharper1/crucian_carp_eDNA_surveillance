Data needed to run analyses in R [(here)](https://github.com/lrharper1/crucian_carp_eDNA_surveillance/tree/master/Data/)


## Setting up the environment

In order to retrieve scripts and associated data, start by cloning this repository to your current directory:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lrharper1/crucian_carp_eDNA_surveillance.git
```

In order to make use of our scripts and data, you will have to install R on your computer. R is compatible with all major operating systems, but see CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/) for details.

Once R is installed, open our R script in the R console and simply run the code!
